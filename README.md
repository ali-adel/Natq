**Natq** (ناطق) is an open-source Arabic Text-to-Speech (TTS) system developed as a graduation project at the Faculty of Computing and Artificial Intelligence, Helwan University. This system supports high-quality Arabic speech synthesis using modern deep learning models—built from scratch using public datasets and designed to handle diacritization and grapheme-to-phoneme (G2P) conversion for Arabic.

## 📜 Abstract

Arabic is a complex and low-resource language for TTS. Our project tackles the challenges of limited annotated speech corpora and the absence of diacritics, which are essential for correct pronunciation. We propose a modular Arabic TTS system using deep learning with:

- Transformer-based mel-spectrogram generators
- A state-of-the-art HiFi-GAN vocoder
- A novel LLM-based TTS model: Spark-TTS
- Integration of diacritization (CATT) and phoneme conversion (Nawar Halabi’s Phenomizer)
